# SinFlix üé¨

Welcome to SinFlix, a free and open-source project dedicated to bringing Sinhala movies to you in one convenient place.

SinFlix is designed to be a simple, modern, and user-friendly platform that collects and displays Sinhala movies that are already publicly available on the internet. We do not host or store any movie files on our servers. Instead, all content is embedded or linked directly from third-party sources.
